This was my first flutter project.

My resume got shortlisted at CRED and I was given this as an assignment for the flutter developer intern role.

So I made it in the given 2 day deadline taking out time from my daily goals.
Since i was new to flutter, I learnt a lot while working on it and this is how my flutter journey began,

EXTRAS- My assignment was considered and got an interview call also.
Didn't qualified for further rounds but I learnt from my mistakes and working more hard :)

Hope to crack good company soon :D
